I don't love this approach. It feels as if we are sacrificing a lot of the advantages of polymorphism since we still have to declare the type as Cat. Thinking about liskov and duck typing: xat obviously "is a" animal (is an animal...) and it would be nice in many situations to only rely on the behavior of animals rather than have to know the exact type of animal. From the post, however, it seems like in cases in which we don't need to rely on behavior only and there are performance concerns then we could make use of static polymorphism, but the first rule of optimization is don't.
