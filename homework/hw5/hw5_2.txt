Using jthread vs thread seems to have a lot of advantages. Perhaps most importantly is we are no longer required to call join(). Having to call join could lead to bugs when there are exceptions or conditional logic that might require us to remember to call join in many places. Since jthread does this automatically on destruction it seems like it would almost certainly cut down on the amount of bugs we might run into. However in this specific example I ran into some interesting issues. The jthreads won't be destroyed until the main function is completed, because of this without calling join the count prints before the counting is done. In order to fix this I originally destroyed all the threads (by using the vectors clear method), however I decided it was better to still just call join (this time in the original loop) so that it would explicitly join the threads before it got printing the count.
