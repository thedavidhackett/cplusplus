For each implementation I had the following results

In Matrix.cpp
Specialization: 7.2
No Specialization: 15.9

In OverloadMatrix.cpp
Overloading: 8.7
No Overloading: 17.8

In PSMatrix.cpp
Partial Specialization: 6.7 seconds

In each case having a direct method for 2x2 matrices to calculate determinants saved time. It seems having a direct method can be really useful in a case like this when calculations can be simplified.

The problem is the functor is being passed by value so foreach is making a copy. A simple solution would be to use std::ref or alternatively foreach will return a functor with the given state and that can be assigned to a new variable. Both solutions are implemented
