Instead of using raw pointers I opted to use smart pointers, using a unique pointer. This feels like an improvement since its safer and the explicit destructor is no longer needed since the pointers will handle the memory management and release their managed memory when they go out of scope. There could still be situations in which it would make sense to copy the values from the tree into a new tree. Because of this I designed a copy constructor that would go through the tree and copy the values assigning the values to new nodes with unique_ptrs. This version is safer and so better.
