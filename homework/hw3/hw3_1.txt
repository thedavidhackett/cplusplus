Having the += operator as a member function makes more sense than having it as a global function. The + operator by itself is communicative so it does make sense that what ever is being added together to follow the same rules. However since we expect the += to increment the first object in someway it makes sense for the += to rely on the first object to determine those rules. Ie if I use myStringClass += "Hello" I expect the behavior of that incrementing to be described by the myStringClass.
